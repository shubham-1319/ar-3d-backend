  ‚úÖ STEP 1: Navigate to Your Project Folder
In PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
cd "C:\Users\shubh\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\ar-3d-backend"
‚úÖ STEP 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
Activate it:

For PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
You should now see (venv) prefix in your terminal ‚Äî this means you're inside the virtual environment.

‚úÖ STEP 3: Create or Download requirements.txt
Here's a minimal requirements.txt you can use for the Blender-based AR API:

fastapi
uvicorn
python-multipart
Create it by running:

powershell
Copy
Edit
notepad requirements.txt
Paste the above content and save the file.

‚úÖ STEP 4: Install All Requirements
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
‚úÖ STEP 5: Run the API Server
Now run the FastAPI server:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
If your file is named something else (like app.py instead of main.py), adjust accordingly:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn app:app --reload
